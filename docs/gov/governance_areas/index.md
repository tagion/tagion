# Governance Areas

The development of the overall governance of Tagion is, for practical reasons, divided into for interdependent areas:

1. Decision Making
2. Network Formation
3. Token Economy
4. Software Management

We also offer a repository of ideas and approaches, including our appraisal of them in the section currently called "glossary"

Please bear with us, while we fill all of that with life and substance.
