# Tagion Utility Tokens

The term ‘utility’ comes from the Latin word ‘utilitas’, meaning ‘usefulness’. 

Whenever we speak of utility in the context of DLT, we often speak of the 

usefulness of a token. 

The Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation defines a utility token as “a type 

of crypto asset which is intended to provide digital access to a good or service, 

available on DLT”. A utility token is accordingly a digital asset on a distributed 

ledger, granting holders access to certain products or services. Here, we further 

extend the notion of a utility token to encompass a token used for staking in the 

consensus layer and for compensating node operators for validating and 

recording transactions. 

While the classification of a utility token is binary - either it is or isn't a utility 

token - the notion of token utility conversely operates on a spectrum, indicating 

that a token can vary in its usefulness. As such, when speaking of token utility, 

we refer to the usefulness of the token, defined as its ability to access or unlock 

goods and services; the more needed it is for accessing and utilizing services, 

the greater its utility. 

Building on the economist Randal Wray's renowned saying "taxes drive money", 

we may say that "utility drives demand." As a token's utility increases, its demand 

naturally follows, enticing individuals to purchase and use it. Yet, in the world of 

distributed ledger networks, the demand aspect of a token economy frequently 

receives insufficient attention. This oversight can translate into a sub-optimal 

token economy, potentially rendering token utility non-existent. This section 

delves into the intricate token economy underpinning the Tagion Network, 

emphasizing the mechanisms that stimulate demand of its native token, TGN. 

Below, the demand-side dynamics have been illustrated. 

 

TGN serves as a means of payment used by stakeholders when transacting on 

the Tagion Network. However, TGN serves not only as the primary medium for 

network transactions, but also as a pivotal staking instrument within the 

network's sybil-resistant mechanism and as a governance tool in its innovative 

Treasury design. As the backbone of the Tagion Network, TGN will accordingly 

serve as the focal point around which value will revolve, evolve, and unfold.
