# Tagion's twofold objective: Security and Decentralization 

Sybil resistance mechanisms are designed to prevent individuals from gaining disproportionate control over a system by ensuring they cannot spawn multiple identities to manipulate consensus or governance. However, if the very mechanisms intended to prevent Sybil attacks end up concentrating capital and power in the hands of a select few, the network still faces the same issue—a small group exercises outsized control over decision-making and consensus. 

The key difference, of course, is that in the latter scenario, the mechanisms help ensure that those who hold power have a vested interest in the network’s well-being—they are economically incentivized to act responsibly rather than maliciously. However, this does not erase the fundamental problem that it creates an inherently unequal system, where governance and influence become exclusive privileges of the capital-rich rather than being fairly distributed among all participants. 

Ultimately, for a network to increase both security and decentralization, Sybil resistance must not only prevent identity manipulation but also ensure that power remains sufficiently distributed. Otherwise, the system, while protected from Sybil attacks, risks evolving into a plutocracy—one where control is concentrated, entrenched, and inherently unfair, undermining the very ideals of decentralization. 

Therefore, the ultimate purpose of Tagion’s Sybil-resistance mechanism, in alignment with the principles outlined in the Manifesto (link), is twofold: positively, it must ensure the network remains secure against sybil attacks, and negatively, it must actively prevent the consolidation of power, ensuring a fair and decentralized distribution of influence.
