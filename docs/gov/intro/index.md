# Introduction

Welcome to the governance documentation-pages of the Tagion network. 

This documentation is continuous work in progress as is governance. Because, to us, the terms means simultaneously the structure AND processes relating to managing a decentralised system.
 And we want you to feel invited to contribute!

Here, we will outline what Governance means to this project, what is already in place, what the current stewards envision, and how you get involved. 

We will communicate any mayor changes to this in our Discord server. For the moment, stay tuned!
