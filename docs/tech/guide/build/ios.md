# Cross compilling iOS

Tagion libmobile is a subset of the tagion modules which can be cross compiled for iOS.
Compilation for iOS is only supported with OSX/MacOS as a host.


## Setup

1. Install build tools using brew  
*Some tools like `make` are already distributed with OSX, but they're too old and will not work.*  

```
brew install cmake make pkg-config ldc
```

2. Install xcode. Make sure that xcode-select is available

```bash
xcode-select --version
```

## Build

```bash
make DC=ldc2 PLATFORM=arm64-apple-ios libmobile
```

## Available platforms
