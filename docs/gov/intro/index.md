# Introduction

Welcome to the governance documentation-pages of the Tagion network.

On these pages you find the current state of ideas and deliberation. Colored flags will alert you to the parts that are deemed certain, and, on the other hand, those that are hotly debated (in our Discord channels). Everything else is to be considered a proposal or only preliminary formulated. 

We chose to publish this because we want the evolution of the network to be shaped by the collective will of its "community" (the meaning of this and other terms will be specified in the [glossary](./glossary)). Only the values and guiding principles of the Tagion ["Manifesto"](./manifesto) should be adhered to at all times. 

:::tip[The _Tagion Governance Manifesto_]

Our **Manifesto** is the first approved and foundational element of the Tagion governance - download it as a [PDF](https://www.tagion.org/resources/tagion-manifesto.pdf), or read it online [here](./manifesto). 
Going forward, you will be able to easily identify all approved elements through the menu. Everything else on these pages is considered a proposal only - and open for discussion. 

:::

Because governance, to us, simultaneously means the structure and processes of managing a decentralised system - including but not limited to the procedures through which decisions are made, and rules are established - this documentation is structured into four [interdependent areas](./governance_areas). The ideas and process of each of those will have effects and consequences on all others, directly or indirectly, so sometimes you will have to follow links to different sections or the glossary in order to get the full picture. 

As our manifesto says, we use the word "decentralised" to mean a system in which no entity can impose its will and interest on the rest of the users and participants. This also means that the governance of a decentralised system cannot be established up-front, by dictate from the founders, but will have to be co-developed, tested and refined with its stakeholders. 

Practically, Tagion and its underlying technology do not meet this criterion of decentralisation yet. So the governance will evolve, step by step, with the different stages of releasing the network from the stewardship of [Decard](https://www.tagion.org/about/) into full decentralisation.



## Phased decentralisation of Tagion

At the time of writing (find a timestamps of latest updates on the bottom of all pages), the Tagion network is distributed across several nodes, but they are all on Decard's servers and operate in what we call "Mode 1" on the technical side - and **Pre-Release** in terms of governance.

Once the next technical milestone is achieved and nodes that fall out of synchronisation can catch up with the consensus state of the network automatically, a huge step towards decentralisation is achieved. Technically, we call that "Mode 2" (you can find more information on these "modes" in the [Tech documentation](https://docs.tagion.org/tech/architecture/network_modes)).  

In terms of governance, this is where the four "release phases" of the network will start.

### 1. Closed Release

From here, the network nodres will be distributed across different servers in different locations. But, as the name indicates, this phase is not open to external parties who might be eager to operate a node. However, already during this phase the code of our nodes is publicly available on github and the Tech documentation allows savvy operators to set it up, test and audit it. In due time, a new version of nodes will allow more interested parties to run nodes that connect to the network as mirrors, but not participate in the consensus. 

### 2. Limited Release

This second phase will see the network being extended to nodes operated by partners and vetted community members. The onboarding process will be "by invitation" only and strictly controlled by Decard to ensure security and, shall something not go to plan, provide quick support. During this phase, the governance here developed will be tested and improved in a safe environment. The results will be published here as our "Working Paper", ready for tests and verification "in the wild", which will happen in phase 3.

### 3. Curated Release

With this third phase, the network will already feel as decentralised as commonly understood. Technically, this pahse will require the networking operating in "Mode 3" ([see Tech documentation](https://docs.tagion.org/tech/architecture/network_modes) for more about "modes"). We imagine an onboarding process that does not require the input or permission by any entity. The governance system established in the Working Paper will ensure security and coherence of the network. However, for safety and unforeseen events, Decard together with an evolving community council will retain special privileges and can intervene if deemed necessary for the sustainability of the network and the adherence to the principles set out in the manifesto. 

### 4. Singularity

This last stage is not so much a phase as a point in time: it occurs when all privileges in the network are relinquished and only the rules of the then firmly established governance system are followed. 
From here on, the network is truly decentralised in the sense set out in the manifesto.
