# Introduction

Welcome to the governance development- and documantation-pages of the Tagion network.
(For an overview of what Tagion "is", have a look at the website [tagion.org](https://tagion.org) or read the [Technical Concept Paper](https://www.tagion.org/resources/tagion-whitepaper.pdf))

Here, you find the current state of ideas and deliberation in regards to Tagion's governance. 

We chose to publish them throught their development process because we want the evolution of the network to be shaped by the collective will of its "community" (the meaning of this and other terms will be specified in the [glossary](./glossary)). Only the values and guiding principles of the Tagion ["Manifesto"](./manifesto) should be adhered to at all times. 

:::tip[The _Tagion Governance Manifesto_]

Our **Manifesto** is the first approved and foundational element of the Tagion governance - download it as a [PDF](https://www.tagion.org/resources/tagion-manifesto.pdf), or read it online [here](./intro/manifesto). 
Going forward, you will be able to easily identify all approved elements through the menu. Everything else on these pages is considered a proposal only - and open for discussion.

## About Governance
Governance, to us, simultaneously means the processes of managing a decentralised system and the strucutre of the network thatemerges from that same management process. As such the term includes, but is not limited to the procedures through which decisions are made and rules are established or changed. 

As our manifesto says, we use the word "decentralised" to mean a system in which no entity can impose its will and interest on the rest of the users and participants. This also means that the governance of a decentralised system cannot be established up-front, by dictate from the founders, but will have to be co-developed, tested and refined with its stakeholders. 

## Governance Areas 

To make it easier for our communtiy to navigation our governance ideas, and chime in to their development, this website is splits governances into four [interdependent areas](./governance_areas). The ideas and process of each of those will have effects and consequences on all others, directly or indirectly, so sometimes you will have to follow links to different sections, or the glossary, in order to get the full picture. 
These four areas are: 

[Decision Making](/gov/governance_areas/decision_making): This encompasses all rules and procedures in regard to voting and proposal procedures, eligibility criteria, or council privileges. Decision making influences all other goverance areas because if the community follows the rules set out here (and honors the values of the Tagion manifesto) everything else about the network can be changed.  

[Network  Formation](/gov/governance_areas/network_formation): This governance area is concerned with the composition of network and the relationship between its active components. This is, in a nutshell, about becoming an active node. As such consideration about security (sybil resistance mechanisms) and consensus are of central importance, but also how to ensure the network gets decentrlaised, remains permissionless and functions efficiently. 

[Token Economy](/gov/governance_areas/token_economy): This governance area is mostly concerned with everything to do with the TGN utility tokens and the way it is used with in the network. As with any economy, this concerns the supply side of the TGN tokens (issuance, allocation, vesting) and the demand side (fees and incentives). 

[Software Development](/gov/governance_areas/software_development): This governance area is concerned with the maintenance and ongoing upgrades of the software that powers the Tagion Network. Through the principles here described, community members will deliberate and vote on node software updates, the integration of new technologies, and enhancements to system performance. 


## Process

Practically, Tagion and its underlying technology do not meet the criterion of decentralisation yet. Acrodingly, the governance will evolve, step by step, along with the different stages of releasing the network from the stewardship of [Decard](https://www.tagion.org/about/) into full decentralisation. (See the [following page](/gov/intro/phased_release) for the sequence of that phased release).

Only with [Phase 3](/gov/intro/phased_release.md#3-curated-release) will we have reached a consolidated governance system, that will then be tested in practice. That system will be describe in our "Governance Working Paper", which will be published here in due time. 

Until then, everything (but our manifesto) is to be considered a proposal or only preliminary formulated, and open to your input. Colored flags(boxes) will alert you to the parts that are deemed certain, or those that are hotly debated in our Discord channels.

There, we will also communicate any major updates of these pages.
