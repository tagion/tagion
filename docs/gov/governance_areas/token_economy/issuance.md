# TGN Issuance & Allocation

The maximum supply of TGN tokens is currently set to be 37bn.  (See list of definitions below.) 

 

Half of this was minted in what was previously referred to as our “Token Generator Event” (TGE) which happened along with the launch of the Tagion mainnet on Dec 7th 2023. 

 

Most of these 18.5bn have not been issued yet but all are earmarked/dedicated to different purposes in regard to the development of the Tagion network. This is here called the tokens’ “allocation”: 


| Allocation/Purpose:   | Amount:  |
| -------- | ------- |
| To disburse to **pre-sale investors**:
Sold by Decard Services GmbH (a wholly owned and regulated subsidiary of Decard Group). Revenue from pre-sale went to Decard Group for the development and initial maintenance and advancement of Tagion core infrastructure.   | 3.1bn ~ 8.5% <br>of max supply    |
| To disburse to **post-sale investors**:
Continues to be sold by Decard Services GmbH. Revenue goes to Decard (or potentially other services providers) for the ongoing development, maintenance and advancement of Tagion core infrastructure. | 4.4bn ~ 11.5% <br>of max supply|
| To disburse to **active Tagion community**:        (labelled “Ecosystem” in previous version) 
To incentivize and reward the wider community, including users, developers, and other key stakeholders. The goal is to foster engagement and participation in ways that enhance the growth, security, and overall well-being of the Tagion Network and its ecosystem. This may encompass direct payments in TGN, airdrops, liquidity provision, grants and more. Once an independent steward entity is established, it can also sell part of this allocation to advance the above purpose in other ways.| 4.0bn ~ 11% <br>of max supply <br>(As of 2025: 27.5Mio were disbursed)|| To disburse to Decard   | 4.0bn ~ 11% <br>of max supply|
|To disburse to **Decard** | 4.0bn ~ 11% <br>of max supply|
|To disburse to **team and founders** | 3.0bn ~ 8% <br>of max supply| 
|**Total Current Allocations**|**18.5bn** ~ 50% <br>of max supply|

The other half of the max supply is scheduled to be minted on a continues bases over a period of approximately 30 years (616 million annually - changes to this schedule can be introduced later by community decision). These tokens will be directly assigned to the then established Tagion Treasury and used, along with other resources, to reward node operators as well as to continuously incentivise community engagement, governance, network maintenance and software upgrades.  

This secondary minting process (previously referred to as “emission”) starts once significant advances in decentralising Tagion have been achieved (see Phase 3. Curated Release).  

Vesting & Circulation 

 

It is important to prevent too many tokens being made available at the same time so that they do not flood the market prematurely and destabilize the token's value. 

To achieve this, tokens sold in pre- or post-sales, or otherwise assigned are not immediately disbursed to the beneficiaries' JustPay wallets, but held back/locked in the Tagion portal. The time for which assigned tokens are locked is called the “vesting period”. 

After this period the unlocked tokens are said to be “fully vested” and their disbursement can be requested in the Tagion portal. Since these requests will typically not happen right after the vesting period ends, we distinguish between the vested supply (tokens that can be disbursed) and the circulating supply (tokens that have been disbursed).

|**Total** <br>Supply  |Amount of TGN tokens that have been minted at a given moment (fixed to 18.5bn until start of release phase 3).  |
| **Assigned** <br>Supply   | Amount of TGN tokens sold to investors (with vesting schedule) or otherwise assigned to individual owners (with or without vesting terms) but not yet disbursed.|
| **Vested** <br>Supply  | Amount of TGN tokens that had been assigned with vesting terms and are now eligible to be disbursed.|
| **Circulating** <br>Supply[^1]   | Amount of TGN tokens that have been disbursed to individual wallets and can be used or sold on the market. |

In June 2024, the vested supply was at 1,975,000,000 TGN. In March 2025 out of the 3,129,452,528 TGN that have been sold (in pre- and post-sales) or assigned to community members,  816,151,055 TGN were fully vested and unlocked for payouts.   

Since disbursements/payouts of vested tokens are not automatically initiated at the end of a given vesting period, there is no way of calculating the amount of circulating tokens for the future. But we will report on the actual circulating supply at regular intervals.   

In June 2024, when the last “Tokenomics Paper” was published, the circulating supply (then reported without tokens assigned to team and founders) was at 21,700,000 TGN.  In March 2025, the circulating supply as defined above is at 132,839,898TGN. 

Vesting can be time-based, where tokens are released systematically over a predetermined timeline, event-based, where tokens are released upon achieving specific milestones or events, or price-based, where tokens are released upon achieving a set market price. By predominantly using time-based vesting, the Tagion Network ensures a steady token release into circulation, fostering a predictable token evolution on the supply-side of TGN. This results in an increase in vested supply as shown in the graphic below. 



[^1]: We previously reported on “Circulating Supply” excluding any tokens disbursed to the team, founders and shareholders. While an industry standard for this term seems far off(see for example discussion at this page), we are now using the above more inclusively and intuitive definition.
