# Introduction

Welcome to the governance documentation-pages of the Tagion network. 

These pages will be continuously updated as our network matures. 

Governance, to us, simultaneously means the structure AND processes of managing a decentralised system.
And structure and process will change in step with the stage release of our network - and with your input. 

Please feel invited to contribute! For the time being, this happens on Discord (join [here](https://discord.gg/wE4AA64a)).

To break up our ideas and make them easier to follow, we have stuctured the governance of our network into four interdependent areas (see menu). 
The structure and process of each of those will have effects and consequences on all other, directly or indirectly. 

Also, most of the elements here described will be implemented in stages along with the technical development of the network and its staged release from the stewardship of [Decard](https://www.tagion.org/about/). 

## Release phases of Tagion

The word "decentralisation" here refers to a network in which no entity can impose it's will and interest on the rest of the network.
Practically, this is not true yet. But the current network stewards at Decard have bond themselves to make this vision a reality as soon as possible.
For this purpose, our ["Manifesto"](./manifesto) sets out the values and ambitions for Tagion, as guiding principles throughout the development process. 

At the time of writing (find date of last update on bottom right of all pages), the Tagion network is distributed acorss several nodes, but they are all on Decard servers and operate in what we call "Mode 1". Once the next technical milestone is achieved and nodes that fall out of synchronisation can catch up with the consensus state of the network automatically, a huge step towards decentralization is achieved. Our dev-team calls that "Mode 2" and you can find more information on these terms in their [Tech documentation](https://docs.tagion.org/tech/architecture/network_modes). 
In terms of governance, this is where the "release phases" of the network will start. The first of these is the 

### Closed Release

As the name indicates, this phase is not open to external parties who might be eager to operate a node themselves. However, already during this phase the code of our nodes is publicly available on github and the Tech documentation allows savvy operators to set it up, test and audit it. In due time, a new version of nodes will allow more interested parties to run nodes that connect to the network as mirrors, but not participate in the consensus. 

### Limited Release

### Curated Release

### Singularity



## Glossary

These documentation pages also contain a glossary where we will record induvidual concepts, ideas and proposal, and highlight our evaluation of them - even if they are not included in the governance of the four areas at the moment. 

## Stay tuned!

We will communicate any mayor changes to this in our Discord server. For the moment, stay tuned!
