# Building documentation

The documentation site is based on [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a documentation generator built by The Facebook.  
You'll need node20 and npm to build it.

# Installation

```bash
cd docs/
npm install
```

After feeding the black hole you'll be able to build the documentation

# Start a development server
```
npm run start
```


# Build

This will output the html files docs/dist/

```
npm run build
```
