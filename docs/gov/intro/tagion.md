# Draft: What is Tagion

Tagion is the name of a noval distributed database technology that combines highly efficient protocols for inter-node communication, consensus and decentralisation. 

It combines a suite of privacy, transparency and data-control options previously only found, in part, in traditional databases or DLT systems respectively. 

It is based upon a patentet database called DART - the "Distributed Archive of Random Transactions". It allows for data-control (own,read, write, share) at the archive level. 

The consensus of between network nodes is achieved by a version of the SWIRLDS Hashgraph protocol, enhanced by patented Wavefront communication protocol that achieves minimal overheads as an Atomic Broadcast Protocol.  It features a high tolerance toward Byzantine Faults (only 2/3 of all nodes need to be compliant) and provides fast and deterministic finality with fair timebased ordering. 

The Tagion Mainnet is designed to become highly decentralized, with security guaranteed through the innovative "proof of community" and randomised rotation of validator nodes. 

This is supplemented with federated Subsystems which are independent in their governance, including node permissions and privacy setting. However, these Subsystems are required to submit regular signets of their current state to the Mainnet. This way, the Mainnet provides a quasi-public notary service and verification layer to the individual business and use-cases of the Subsystems, enhancing confidence and trust in any mulit-stakeholder setting. 

Usage of the Tagion Mainnet is charged for in it's native TGN utility token. 

The Tagion technology stack was concieved of in 2017 and remaines under continuous development by Decard AG, the current stewardship entity guiding Tagion through to full deployment and decentralisation. All code is published open-source and use of the Tagion Mainnet aswell as the operation of federated Subsystems does not incure licencing fees. 

The development and deployment of all aspects of the Tagion project have to comply with the guiding princeples described in the Tagion governance manifesto. 

A non-technical step-by-step description of the functionality of Tagion can be found on here, on the adjacent governance development and documentation pages, which also cover questions of sybil resistance and tokenomics. 

:::info[Previous Documentaion]

Since 2019, preliminarily ideas and concepts about Tagion had been described in "Technical", "Concept" and "Tokenomics" papers, published in PDF format. <br>
They are all considered superseeded by the information on these pages - everything current is now found here. 

But if you are interested in the history of our thinking, you can find the old publications in our [archive](https://docs.tagion.org/gov/intro/archive).
