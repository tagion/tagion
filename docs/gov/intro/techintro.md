# Introduction to the Tagion Tech Documentation

Welcome to the documentation pages of the Tagion project.

On this site, you will find the current design and state of our [architecture]https://docs.tagion.org/tech/architecture, [protocols](https://docs.tagion.org/tech/protocols), how to [set up and use Tagion](https://docs.tagion.org/tech/guide) for yourself, and more (see side-menu).  

For an overview of what Tagion "is", have a look at the following [short description](/gov/intro/tagion) and the project's [website tagion.org](https://tagion.org).



:::info[Previous Documentaion]

Since 2019 we had preliminarily described a lot of our ideas in PDF publications: our "Technical", "Concept" and "Tokenomics" papers. They are now all considered superseeded by the information on these pages, and everything current is now found here. But if you are interested in the history of our thinking you can find the old publications in our [archive](./intro/archive))

## Process and Governance

Currently, Tagion is developed by it's steward comapny Decard ([www.decard.io](https://www.decard.io/)). The code is published open-source on Github. 

The Mainnet has been launched in a closed environment in December 2023, and a phased release process towards distribution and decentralization is schedudled to commence in the second half of 2025.

The development of Tagion's network governance is documented on the sister-site - see ["Gov"](https://docs.tagion.org/gov/intro) in the main menu.  

As our manifesto states, we use the word "decentralised" to mean a system in which no entity can impose its will and interests on the rest of the users and participants. 
This also means that the governance of a decentralised system cannot be established upfront by the founders but must be co-developed, tested and refined with its stakeholders. 

On all developemental aspects - code and governance - are welcoming contributions, please get in touch via our Discord server, join [here](https://discord.gg/wE4AA64a)!


:::tip[The _Tagion Governance Manifesto_]

Our **Manifesto** is the foundational element of Tagion's governance - and the common denominator to be adhered to by all contributors and developments. 
Download it as a [PDF](https://www.tagion.org/resources/tagion-manifesto.pdf), or read it online [here](./intro/manifesto).
