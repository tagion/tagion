:::info
The tagion sdk is actively being worked on
:::

We provide C-ABI compatible library called libtauonapi. Which provides most important functions for building client funtionality for tagion. 
The documentation for all of the functions are here https://ddoc.tagion.org/tagion.api.html  

Currently we don't have any officially supported language bindings.  
However we provide a list of examples for integrating with different languages here https://github.com/tagion/tagion/tree/current/src/lib-api/tests/
