# Tagion

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Tagion project! 

Tagion is a decentralized ledger for creating high volume transaction.
It differs from blockchain based ledgers in that it uses a hashgraph as the consensus mechanism and a database based on a merkletree (DART) to store the bills of the system.
Thus it does not need to record the entire transaction history to maintain integrity, only the state of world is recorded.

## Installation
*Installation tested on ubuntu 22.04, nixos-unstable*

### Setup steps & preflight checks

1. First of all please be sure that you have everything, command
You can run the following commands, if you are using arch, nix or ubuntu
    
- **Ubuntu**

```bash
apt-get install git autoconf build-essential libtool dub cmake
```
Download a D compiler ldc or dmd

- LLVM D compiler - ldc2 (v1.37.0)
```bash
wget https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases/download/v1.37.0/ldc2-1.37.0-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
tar xf ldc2-1.37.0-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
export PATH="path-to-ldc2/ldc2-1.37.0-linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH"
```
        
- Reference D compiler - dmd (v2.107.1)
```bash
wget https://downloads.dlang.org/releases/2.x/2.107.1/dmd.2.107.1.linux.tar.xz
tar xf dmd.2.107.1.linux.tar.xz
export PATH="path-to-dmd2/dmd2/linux/bin64:$PATH"
```

- **Arch**

```bash
pacman -Syu git make autoconf gcc libtool dlang cmake
```

- **Nix**

```bash
nix develop
```

2. Verify that the binaries are available and check their version (comments showing versions used as of writing)
    
```bash
ldc2 --version # LDC - the LLVM D compiler (1.37.0): ...
dmd --version # v2.107.1
```

3. Cloning tagion repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tagion/tagion.git
```

### Compiling

1. Running tests

```bash
make test
```

2. Compiling binaries

```bash
make tagion
make install
# Will install to dir specified by INSTALL=/path/to/dir
# This directory should also be in your PATH variable
# such that you can use the tools from you shell
```

3. General info about build flow

```bash
# Help info
make help
# or
make help-<topic>

# Info about environment variables
make env
# or
make env-<topic>
```

4. Compilation options, can be specified on the commandline or in a `local.mk` in the project root

Notice that if you choose to compile with ldc there is a bug which means that the unittests wont run.

```bash
# Showing the default values
ONETOOL=1 # ALL tools linked in to a single executable
          # and individual tools are symbolic links to that binary
DC=       # D compiler to use, default will try to pick between dmd and ldc2
CC=       # C compiler to use, default will try to pick between gcc and clang
```

### Profiling 

Profiling can be enabled in two way.

#### Buildin profiler
Enable the dmd build profiler with the `PROFILE` environment.
```bash
make PROFILE=1 DC=dmd <target>
```
The result of the profile can be sorted and displayed with the `tprofile` (onetool).


#### Profiling Valgrind
Valgrind profiler can be started with the `VALGRIND` environment.

Run the unittest with [valgrind](https://valgrind.org) and [callgrind](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cl-manual.html).
```bash
make VALGRIND=1 unittest
```
Any of the test/bdd target can be executed with the `VALGRIND=1`.

Note. The result from the `callgrind` viewed with [Kcachegrind](https://kcachegrind.github.io/html/Home.html).
