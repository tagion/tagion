# Network Formation

:::tip[Under Development]

Everything found here reflects our best efforts of building a public infrastructure that serves the needs of all our users on the short and long run. Please help us shape Tagion's goverance structure by chiming into the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wE4AA64a). 

:::

We structure the governance area "network formation"[^1] into two sections with three chapters each:

**Introductions** - three reflective chapters about the issues of network formation

 1. [Why Sybil Resistance Matters](./network_formation/introductions/sybil)
 2. [Thoughts on "Re-centralisation"](./network_formation/introductions/recentralisation)
 3. [Revisiting Permissionlessness](./network_formation/introductions/permission)

**Proof of Community** - three chapters about what we propose:

 5. [What "Proof of Community" is (good for)](./network_formation/tagion/poc)
 7. [How "Genetics" feature in Proof of Community](./network_formation/tagion/genetics)
 8. [How we calculate a "Reputation Score"](./network_formation/tagion/reputation)

[^1]: As our [glossary](/gov/glossary#formation) explains, we use this word analogous to its dual meaning in geology: the process of forming something AND the resulting structure (as in "rock formation").
