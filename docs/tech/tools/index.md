If installed correctly then you should have a tagion executable file available.
It's a single file which includes all tools.

List the available
```
tagion --help
```

The tools can be run as

```bash
tagion <tool>
```

Or simply.
This requires that there is a symbolic link to with the name of the tool to the original executable
```bash
<tool>
```
