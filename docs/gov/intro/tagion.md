# Draft: What is Tagion

Tagion is the name of a novel distributed database technology that combines highly efficient protocols for communication and consensus with a decentralized network architecture. 

It combines a suit of privacy and transparency and data-control options previously only found in part in traditional databases or DLT systems. 

The Tagion Mainnet is set-up to become highly decentralized, allowing the greatest number of actors to operate nodes. This is supplemented with federated Subsystems, that are independent in their governance and data-settings, but submitting regular signets to the Mainnet which serves as quasi-public notary service and verification layer that enhances confidence and trust in mulit-stakeholder settings. 

The technology was concieved of in 2017 and remained under continuous development by Decard AG, the current stewardship entitys seeing Tagion through to full deployment and decentralisation.
