# Draft: What is Tagion

Tagion is the name of a noval distributed database technology that combines highly efficient protocols for inter-node communication, consensus and decentralisation. 

It combines a suite of privacy, transparency and data-control options previously only found, in part, in traditional databases or DLT systems respectively. 

something about DART
Hashgraph (upgraded by) Wavefront (theoretically minimal communication complexity)
Atomic broadcast protocol (A protocol where every node eventually agrees on the ordering of information is called an Atomic Broadcast Protocol (ABP))
aBFT. 
Determinstic finality (and fast)
fair ordering
Swapping? Proof-of-community
TGN

The Tagion Mainnet is designed to become highly decentralized, allowing the greatest number of actors to operate nodes. This is supplemented with federated Subsystems which are independent in their governance and data-settings, but required to submit regular signets of their state to the Mainnet. This way, the Mainnet provides a quasi-public notary service and verification layer to the individual business and use-cases of the Subsystems, enhancing confidence and trust in any mulit-stakeholder setting. 

The technology was concieved of in 2017 and remaines under continuous development by Decard AG, the current stewardship entity guiding Tagion through to full deployment and decentralisation.
