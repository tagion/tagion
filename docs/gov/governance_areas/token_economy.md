## Fees and Rewards 

Contributors [Glossary link] play a vital role in ensuring the sustainability and growth of the Tagion network. Their efforts span across maintaining and safeguarding the network’s security, efficiency, and reliability; driving its evolution by implementing upgrades, addressing vulnerabilities, and introducing new features; and fostering adoption by creating educational materials and onboarding users. 

The Tagion network’s success depends on the ongoing participation of contributors. However, without an adequate reward model in place, there is a risk that participation could decline over time. Contributors typically invest significant time, expertise, and resources into maintaining and improving the network. If these efforts are not recognized and rewarded, contributors may reduce their involvement or disengage entirely, posing a threat to the network’s robustness, stability, and ability to evolve. 

While some individuals or entities may contribute out of goodwill, ideological alignment, or interest in supporting their own applications, these motivations may not be sufficient to ensure sustained long-term participation. To ensure the network's continued resilience and performance, it is essential to establish a framework that both acknowledges the value of contributors' work and incentivizes their long-term engagement. This framework should aim to compensate contributors fairly for their efforts, ensuring they remain motivated. 

A key tool for ensuring the continued participation of contributors is the use of the network’s native token, TGN, as a form of compensation. TGN can serve as both an incentive and a mechanism to align contributors’ interests with the network’s growth. By compensating contributors in TGN, their success becomes directly tied to the network's adoption and value appreciation, encouraging long-term engagement and ongoing contributions to the network. 

## The Path from Fees to Rewards via Treasury 

The Tagion Treasury [Glossary link] will serve as the primary source of compensation for contributors, utilizing its holdings of TGN tokens to fund ongoing network operations. Initially, the Treasury will draw from its allocated TGN reserves to support the system and reward contributors. However, since these reserves are finite, the Treasury cannot sustain the network indefinitely through this allocation alone. 

In the event that the Treasury exhausts its initial holdings, the Community could opt to issue new TGN tokens to cover expenses. However, issuing additional tokens would dilute the existing supply, which may not be in the interest of the community. To avoid this outcome, a sustainable and balanced funding model should be established well before the Treasury’s reserves are depleted, ensuring the network's long-term sustainability. 

The proposed model assumes that users will ultimately cover the ongoing costs of compensating relevant contributors through usage fees, which will be paid into the Treasury and then distributed to node operators, developers, and other contributors. 

From the Treasury's perspective, fees will be accumulated through four primary channels, namely: 

+ Execution Fees [link] 

+ Storage Fees [link] 

+ Relay Fees [link] 

+ Subsystem Taxes [link] 

Fees paid by users through one of the above four channels establish a direct link between the network's utility and the resources required to maintain and improve it. By aligning the cost of upkeep with the network's usage, this model ensures that those who derive value from the network contribute proportionally to its maintenance. 

In this way, the Tagion Treasury will transition from relying solely on its initial reserves to a more self-sustaining model, where ongoing operational costs are funded by the network’s users. This reduces dependency on finite reserves and avoids the need to dilute the token supply, promoting a healthier, long-term economic framework for the network.
