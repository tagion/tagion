# What is Tagion

Tagion is the name of a groundbraking distributed database technology that combines highly efficient protocols for inter-node communication, consensus and decentralisation. 

It combines a suite of **privacy, transparency and data-control** options previously only found, in part, in traditional databases or DLT systems respectively. 

It is based upon a patented database called **DART** - which stands for "[Distributed Archive of Random Transactions](https://docs.tagion.org/tech/protocols/dart)". For enhanced security and to allow for native ownership and data-control (own,read, write, share) at the archive level, the DART functions on a custom dataformat called [**HiBON**](https://www.hibon.org/posts/hibonproperties/) (Hash invariant Binary Object Notation). This also enables easy verifyability and unprecedented low storage, bandwidth and processing power requirments. It is also the basis of our bespoke communication format [**HiRPC**](https://www.hibon.org/posts/hirpc/). 

The consensus between network nodes is achieved by a version of the SWIRLDS [**Hashgraph** protocol](https://docs.tagion.org/tech/protocols/consensus/HashGraph), enhanced by [patented **Wavefront**](https://docs.tagion.org/tech/protocols/wavefront) communication protocol that achieves minimal overheads as an Atomic Broadcast Protocol.  It features a high tolerance toward Byzantine Faults (only 2/3 of all nodes need to be compliant) and provides **fast and deterministic** finality with timebased **fair ordering**. 

Tagion's stateless smart contracts enable parallel excution on the **Tagion Virtual Machine** (TVM) which is based on the open WebAssembly standard.

The **Tagion Mainnet** is designed to become highly decentralized, with security guaranteed through the innovative "[**proof of community**](https://docs.tagion.org/gov/governance_areas/network_formation/tagion)" protocol and randomised rotation of validator nodes. 

This is supplemented with [**Federated Subsystems**](https://docs.tagion.org/gov/intro/network) which are independent in their governance, including node permissions and privacy setting. However, these Subsystems are required to submit regular signets of their current state to the Mainnet. This way, the Mainnet provides a quasi-**public notary service** and verification layer to the individual business and use-cases of the Subsystems, enhancing confidence and trust in any **multi-stakeholder** setting. 

Utilisation of Tagion Technology, be it on the Mainnet or through a Federated Subsystems, incures usage fees payable in Tagion's native [**TGN utility tokens**](https://docs.tagion.org/gov/governance_areas/token_economy/utility_token).

The Tagion technology stack was conceived of in 2017 and remains under continuous development by [**Decard AG**](https://www.decard.io/), partly funded by tokens sales through Decard Services GmbH. Together, they form Decard Group which is the initial **stewardship entity** guiding Tagion through to full deployment and decentralisation. All code is published open-source and use of Tagion Mainnet and operation of Federated Subsystems do not incur licencing fees for propriotary technologies and patents.

Now and going forward, the development and deployment of all aspects of the Tagion project have to comply with the guiding principles described in the [**Tagion governance manifesto**](https://docs.tagion.org/gov/intro/manifesto). 

A [non-technical step-by-step description](https://docs.tagion.org/gov/intro/jargonbusting) of the functionality of Tagion can be found on the adjacent governance development and documentation pages, which also cover questions of sybil resistance and tokenomics. 

:::info[Previous Documentation]

Since 2019, preliminary ideas and concepts about Tagion had been described in "Technical", "Concept" and "Tokenomics" papers, published in PDF format.  
They are all considered superseded by the information on these pages - everything current is now found here. 

But if you are interested in the history of our thinking, you can find the old publications in our [archive](https://docs.tagion.org/gov/intro/archive).
