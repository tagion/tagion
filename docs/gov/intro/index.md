# Introduction

Welcome to the governance documentation-pages of the Tagion network.

On these pages you find the current state of ideas and deliberation. Colored flags will alert you to the parts that are deemed certain, and, on the other hand, those that are hotly debated (in our Discord channels). Everything else is to be considered a proposal or only preliminary formulated. 

We chose to publish this because we want the evolution of the network to be shaped by the collective will of its "community" (the meaning of this and other terms will be specified in the [glossary](./glossary)). Only the values and guiding principles of the Tagion ["Manifesto"](./manifesto) should be adhered to at all times. 

:::tip[The _Tagion Governance Manifesto_]

Our **Manifesto** is the first approved and foundational element of the Tagion governance - download it as a [PDF](https://www.tagion.org/resources/tagion-manifesto.pdf), or read it online [here](./intro/manifesto). 
Going forward, you will be able to easily identify all approved elements through the menu. Everything else on these pages is considered a proposal only - and open for discussion. 

:::

Because governance, to us, simultaneously means the structure and processes of managing a decentralised system - including but not limited to the procedures through which decisions are made, and rules are established - this documentation is structured into four [interdependent areas](./governance_areas). The ideas and process of each of those will have effects and consequences on all others, directly or indirectly, so sometimes you will have to follow links to different sections or the glossary in order to get the full picture. 

As our manifesto says, we use the word "decentralised" to mean a system in which no entity can impose its will and interest on the rest of the users and participants. This also means that the governance of a decentralised system cannot be established up-front, by dictate from the founders, but will have to be co-developed, tested and refined with its stakeholders. 

Practically, Tagion and its underlying technology do not meet this criterion of decentralisation yet. So the governance will evolve, step by step, with the different stages of releasing the network from the stewardship of [Decard](https://www.tagion.org/about/) into full decentralisation.




We will communicate any major updates and publications on these pages through our Discord channels. Please feel invited to join and contribute [here](https://discord.gg/wE4AA64a).
