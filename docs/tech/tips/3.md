# Subscription API

This proposal aims to aid the [contract tracing proposal](/tips/2), by providing an external API to query the data. And making real time data easier to access.


## Motivation
Current wallet implementations rely on polling the shell in order the know. When their balance has changed and when a transaction has gone through.
The obviously superior alternative is to let the server notify the client when it has data. Be that via long-polling, socket, SSE etc...
Note: the kernel node exposes a nng subscription socket which publishes all data to the connected clients where data is filtered client-side.
This socket is not intended to be exposed externally.


## Requirements
The API should be content driven, cheap for the server decide which events to send,
while stile being flexible enough the clients should do minimal filtering.

## Proposed Solution

The client sends a HiRPC with the `subscribe` method. 
The single parameter is object with the following structure.

```
struct SubFilter {
    @optional string typename;
    @optional DARTIndex[] dartindex;
    @optional Archive.Type
    bool verify() {
        return !typename.empty || !dartindex.empty;
    }
}
```

A response event should be the same format as the response to a `dartRead` command.
It should contain a recorder with documents matching the filter.

## Examples

Subscribe to any new updated document which you own.

`trt.subscribe`
```
SubFilter sub;
sub.typename = "$@trt";
sub.dartindex = [dartindex(#$Y, <mypubkey>)];
```

Subscribe to new epochs

`subscribe`
```
SubFilter sub;
sub.typename = $@E;
```
