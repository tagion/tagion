# Network Architecture

The system architecture is composed of a Mainnet  and a series of Federated Sub-Systems, supported by three distinct types of nodes, and the continuous contributions of developers. Together, these ensure the efficient operation, security, and evolution of the network: 

## Nodes

Core Nodes: At the heart of the system, core nodes are tasked with maintaining the database and reaching agreement on the data submitted and stored—a process referred to as “consensus” [Glossary link]. These nodes uphold the integrity and security of the system, ensuring that the data stored is accurate and protected.  

Relay Nodes: These nodes act as intermediaries, collecting, collating, and managing user requests to submit or retrieve data. Because they also filter out spam and unnecessary requests, they significantly reduce the load on core nodes, enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. 

Mirror Nodes: Mirror nodes maintain a full or partial snapshot of the database and update that at given self-selected intervals. Their primary function is to facilitate easy and efficient data retrieval for users while also alleviating the demand on core nodes. 

## Stakeholders

Developers: Developers are essential to the system, building and maintaining the Mainnet and its Federated Sub-systems. They ensure the network’s reliability and evolution by implementing upgrades, adding new features, and addressing vulnerabilities.
