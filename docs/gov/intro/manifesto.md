# The Tagion Manifesto


_Written by Decard (decard.io), the initial steward of the Tagion network, published on January 10, 2025_ (Download Manifesto as [PDF](https://www.tagion.org/resources/tagion-manifesto.pdf))



## Motivation
Control over monetary and financial systems has long been synonymous
with power, allowing those at the helm to steer the course of economies
and, consequently, whole societies. This control has mostly resided with
governments and commercial institutions, whose interests have not always
aligned with those of the broader public. This has led to forms of money
that often work to the advantage of a select few at the expense of the many,
in effect deepening social and economic divides. Today, as commercial
interests exert more and more control over monetary systems, they have
evolved into conduits for speculative investments that drive social,
ecological, and financial instability.
Recognising these systemic imbalances, the Tagion network was born to
challenge the status quo of money and finance. Tagion is envisioned as an
open and decentralised financial infrastructure—governed by and for the
people. Free from commercial dominance and state interference, Tagion is
set to evolve into a supranational network, accessible to everyone,
regardless of geographic or socio-economic boundaries.
Guided by the conviction that innovation in money and finance should be
open to all, the intention with Tagion is for it to be a public infrastructure
designed to empower local communities, organisations and everyday
individuals, cultivating a rich ecosystem of financial services and
complementary currencies. By doing so, Tagion shall promote the vision of
more inclusive, equitable, sustainable, and cooperative economies.


## Background
A decentralised system like Tagion does not start by itself. It needs to be
conceived, designed, developed, built, and fostered—until it achieves the
level of maturity that allows for it to be self-sustained and indeed fully
decentralised. Tagion’s inception came from three individuals—Theis
Simonsen, Carsten Rasmussen, and Kristian Vestergaard—who founded
Decard (previously i25s) as the leadership vehicle to realise the ambitions
for Tagion as set out above.
At the time or writing, Decard is acting as the custodian for funds raised
for that purpose and as the legal entity managing the technical development
of the Tagion software and its safe release and staged implementation.
With the software fully operational and released as open source, additional
forms of leadership will be required for the development of emergent
governance structures that will take Tagion from its early closed and
protected test environment into an open and decentralised network.
Governance here means all the rules and procedures relating to ownership,
operation, funding, and maintenance — or, in a nutshell: the
decision-making about all aspects at all stages of Tagion’s development.
But since a truly decentralised system is (at least by our definition)
self-governing, no rule can be fully safeguarded against being changed at a
later stage. In this sense, governance here cannot refer to a predefined set
of rules but must be seen as an ever-evolving system.
To ensure that the development of the Tagion network remains, at all
stages, aligned with the vision set out above, the following Seven Guiding
Principles have been established by Decard. If the alignment of every
element of Tagion’s unfolding governance is checked against these principles
the hope is that Tagion will always remain true to its vision — even when
fully decentralised and thus out of Decard’s stewardship.


## Guiding Principles

### 1. Decentralisation
The Tagion network shall distribute planning and
decision-making responsibilities to the community of the
network, ensuring the network reflects the interests of the many,
not the few. This shall be done to prevent any powerful
entity—be it nation states, commercial entities, or influential
individuals—from imposing their will on the system. As such,
the system will be immune to interference, coercion, or control by
any single group or individual, ensuring a decentralised network
that operates solely on the collective consensus of its community.

### 2. Inclusivity
The Tagion network shall be inclusive and accessible, striving to
ensure that all individuals, regardless of economic status or
geographic location, can utilise, develop, and participate in the
governance of the system. It shall promote financial inclusivity
and invite participation from everyone, everywhere.

### 3. Equality of Opportunity
The Tagion network shall strive to provide all participants with
equal opportunities to contribute to and benefit from the
network, without compromising security. It shall strive not to
foster unearned privileges within the network that lead to the
disproportionate accumulation of capital and power, ensuring
that participation and rewards are driven by merit,
collaboration, and contribution.

### 4. Autonomy
Tagion shall operate fully autonomously, never relying on any
external entity to function. It shall enable users to launch
federated Subsystems with bespoke governance and provide the
greatest possible independence and versatility of these systems,
while maintaining the integrity of the federated whole.

### 5. Transparency
All rules of the Tagion system and the amounts transacted
thereon shall remain public and verifiable. All software code,
governance proposals, and documentation of their respective
development shall be published.

### 6. Privacy and Anonymity
Users of the decentralised Tagion Mainnet shall have full
ownership and control over their personal data and how much of
their identity they disclose to other parties. On federated
Subsystems it shall be made possible to balance transparency,
privacy and anonymity to allow for diverse use cases and all
compliance requirements.

### 7. Sustainability
The Tagion network shall operate as a self-sustaining system, not
relying on external funding. It shall evolve through innovation
and continuous development, balancing user needs, community
desires, and environmental considerations.




_Tagion shall always uphold the seven core principles here defined._
