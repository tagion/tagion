# Network Architecture

The system architecture is composed of a **Mainnet**  and a series of **Federated Sub-Systems**, supported by three distinct types of nodes, and the continuous contributions of developers. Together, these ensure the efficient operation, security, and evolution of the network: 

## Nodes:

In Tagion there are currently three types of nodes: 

### Core Nodes
At the heart of the system, core nodes are tasked with maintaining the database and reaching agreement on the data submitted and stored—a process referred to as [consensus](/gov/glossary#consensus). These nodes uphold the integrity and security of the system, ensuring that the data stored is accurate and protected.  

### Relay Nodes
These nodes act as intermediaries, collecting, collating, and managing user requests to submit or retrieve data. Because they also filter out spam and unnecessary requests, they significantly reduce the load on core nodes, enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. 

### Mirror Nodes
Mirror nodes maintain a full or partial snapshot of the database and update that at given self-selected intervals. Their primary function is to facilitate easy and efficient data retrieval for users while also alleviating the demand on core nodes. 


## Contributors:

In a decentralized network, contributors form the foundation, collectively driving its functionality, security, and growth. Unlike traditional centralized systems, where a single entity oversees operations, decentralized networks thrive on the diverse participation of individuals and organizations. These contributors, each bringing their unique strengths, are indispensable in sustaining and advancing the system. 

The term "contributor" itself is fluid, encompassing a wide array of roles that may expand as the network matures and new opportunities for engagement emerge. From the outset, however, contributors can be categorized into three groups:  

### Node Operators 

Node operators provide the essential computational infrastructure that powers the network. They validate transactions, propagate messages, execute smart contracts, and maintain the integrity of the database. Depending on their focus, node operators may run one of the three kinds of nodes described above. Together, these operators sustain the network's reliability and resilience. 

### Developers 

Developers are the architects and innovators of the Tagion Network. They build, maintain, and refine the core protocols and supporting tools. By addressing the evolving needs of the network and its users, developers ensure the system remains robust and scalable. 

### Governance Participants 

Governance Participants play a critical role in shaping the network's future. Through proposals, debates, and voting, they decide, among other things, on protocol upgrades and treasury finances, including fees and rewards. They ensure that the network remains adaptive and aligns with the Manifesto and the interests of its users. 

## Other stakeholders: 

Apart from contributors, there are other entities relevant to Tagion, but not necessarily active in a contributor or community mamber role. 

### Tagion Service Providers 

These develop and provide a range of services built on top of the Tagion Network. They leverage the network's capabilities to create innovative solutions that cater to various needs, such as financial services, supply chain systems, or other utilities, thus enhancing the overall value of the Tagion ecosystem. As Tagion Service Providers craft innovative use cases powered by TGN and gain widespread adoption, the inherent utility of the token inevitably rise. Sevice providers can take on the role of contributors but may choose not to. 

### Users

By our definition, users simply “consume” the services and applications built on top of the Tagion network. They utilize and engage with the services, assets or goods provided by Tagion Service Providers, or other entities, benefiting from the secure and efficient nature of the Tagion network. Users require TGN tokens - puchased on an exchange or earned by selling goods for TGN - to access services and purchase goods.
