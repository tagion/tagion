# Draft: Tagion's Tech Documentation

Welcome to the documentation pages of the Tagion project.

On this site, you will find the current design and state of our [architecture](https://docs.tagion.org/tech/architecture), [protocols](https://docs.tagion.org/tech/protocols), how to [set up and use Tagion](https://docs.tagion.org/tech/guide) for yourself, and more (see side-menu).  

For an overview of what Tagion "is", have a look at the following [short description](/gov/intro/tagion) and the project's [website tagion.org](https://tagion.org).



:::info[Previous Documentation]

Since 2019 we had preliminarily described a lot of our ideas in PDF publications: 
our "Technical", "Concept" and "Tokenomics" papers - they are all considered superseded by the information on these pages - everything current is now found here. 

But if you are interested in the history of our thinking, you can find the old publications in our [archive](https://docs.tagion.org/gov/intro/archive).

## Process and Governance

Currently, Tagion is developed by it's steward company Decard ([www.decard.io](https://www.decard.io/)). The code is published open-source on Github. 

The Mainnet has been launched in a closed environment in December 2023, and a phased release process towards distribution and decentralization is scheduled to commence in the second half of 2025.

The development of Tagion's network governance is documented on an adjacent site - see ["Gov"](https://docs.tagion.org/gov/intro) in the main menu.  

As our manifesto states, we use the word "decentralised" to mean a system in which no entity can impose its will and interests on the rest of the users and participants. 
This also means that the governance of a decentralised system cannot be established upfront by the founders but must be co-developed, tested and refined with its stakeholders. 

On all developmental aspects - code and governance - we welcome contributions. Please get in touch via our Discord server, join [here](https://discord.gg/wE4AA64a)!


:::tip[The _Tagion Governance Manifesto_]

Our **Manifesto** is the foundational element of Tagion's governance - and the common denominator to be adhered to by all contributors and developments. 
Download it as a [PDF](https://www.tagion.org/resources/tagion-manifesto.pdf), or read it online [here](/gov/intro/manifesto).
