# Introduction

Welcome to the governance documentation-pages of the Tagion network. 

This documentation is continuous work in progress as is governance. Because, to us, the terms means simultaneously the structure AND processes relating to managing a decentralised system.
 And we want you to feel invited to contribute!


## Governance Areas

Here, we will outline what Governance means to this project, what is already in place, what the current stewards envision, and how you get involved. 

## Manifesto

 The Manifesto sets the priciples according to which our governance system will be developed.

## Glossary

The Glossary will record individial concepts, ideas and proposal, and highlight our evaluation of them.

## Stay tuned!

We will communicate any mayor changes to this in our Discord server. For the moment, stay tuned!
