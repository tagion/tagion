# Proof-of-Community

With out unique Proof of Community model, Tagion pursues twofold oobjectives:

## Security and Decentralisation

Sybil resistance mechanisms are designed to prevent individuals from gaining disproportionate control over a system by ensuring they cannot spawn multiple identities to manipulate consensus or governance. However, if the very mechanisms intended to prevent Sybil attacks end up concentrating capital and power in the hands of a select few, the network still faces the same issue—a small group exercises outsized control over decision-making and consensus. 

The key difference, of course, is that in the latter scenario, the mechanisms help ensure that those who hold power have a vested interest in the network’s well-being—they are economically incentivized to act responsibly rather than maliciously. However, this does not erase the fundamental problem that it creates an inherently unequal system, where governance and influence become exclusive privileges of the capital-rich rather than being fairly distributed among all participants. 

Ultimately, for a network to increase both security and decentralization, Sybil resistance must not only prevent identity manipulation but also ensure that power remains sufficiently distributed. Otherwise, the system, while protected from Sybil attacks, risks evolving into a plutocracy—one where control is concentrated, entrenched, and inherently unfair, undermining the very ideals of decentralization. 

Therefore, the ultimate purpose of Tagion’s Sybil-resistance mechanism, in alignment with the principles outlined in the Manifesto (link), is twofold: positively, it must ensure the network remains secure against sybil attacks, and negatively, it must actively prevent the consolidation of power, ensuring a fair and decentralized distribution of influence. 

## Proof of Community
To achieve this dual objective, it is essential to cultivate a diverse community of network participants. Since traditional Sybil resistance mechanisms, as argued, have proven inadequate in this respect, we have made a proposal for a novel approach to strengthen trust and security within the Tagion network. 

Our model, dubbed Proof-of-Community, draws inspiration from human social organization, where identity is both inherited and socially validated. The system evaluates identity based on two metrics: 
 

- Genetics – A biologically inspired mechanism that regulates the introduction of new members into the network. New identities are "born" through the mating of two existing members, inheriting a gene code that determines their gene score—a measure of diversity designed to discourage inbreeding. The gene score controls reproduction, ensuring that the network grows in a controlled, decentralized manner and prevents identity farming. 

- Reputation – While identity is established at birth, influence must be earned. Reputation is built over time through peer endorsements, allowing members to gain trust and standing within the network. The higher a member’s reputation score, the greater its influence, meaning members with stronger reputations have more weight in consensus, decision-making, and endorsements. Unlike heredity, which controls who can enter the network, reputation determines how much influence a member has within the system, ensuring that trusted members play a greater role in shaping the network's future. # Tagion's twofold objective: Security and Decentralization
